All models in this section are based off the paper by Tran et al. (2018) with reference to the code on at (Tensorflow)[https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/video/video_classification]. The (mv-extractor)[https://github.com/LukasBommes/mv-extractor] library is used for key frame and motion vector extraction
